## Dataset

The dataset can be found in the folder `data/`. It involves the shape parameters and the effective material properties of ~900 unit cells. Please check the paper for detailed information on the dataset.

## Code Usage

1. Run Matlab code `top3d_sdf_E_nu_dis.m` and `top3d_sdf_E_rho_nu_cmp.m` in folder `TO_opt/` to obtain the optimal material property distribution for the target deformation and compliance minimization problems. 
<!-- The optimal material properties will be saved at `opt/tgt_prp.mat`. -->

2. Create a conda environment called `ihgan`:

   ```
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   ```

3. Train the IH-GAN model and generate unit cell shapes based on the optimal material properties:

   ```
   python gen_shape.py train
   ```

   The trained model will be saved in the folder `trained_model/`. 
   
   The generated unit cell shape parameters will be saved at `opt/dvar_synth.npy` and `opt/dvar_synth.mat`.
   
4. The unit cell shape parameters will then define the geomtries of a unit cell array, which can be assembled to form an optimized metamaterial system.
